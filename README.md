# Learning how to use Streamlit
Testing out Streamlit on some COVID-19 data. 

## Why did I make this app?
I wanted to put to use what I've learned about libraries such as Pandas and Altair. I found Streamlit, a way to make dashboards in Python and since we're in the middle of a pandemic (as of writing this), I wanted to apply it to making a dashboard for visualizing information on COVID-19.
